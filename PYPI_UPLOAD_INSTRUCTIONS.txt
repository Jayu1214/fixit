# PyPI Upload Instructions
========================

1. Get API Tokens:
   - PyPI: https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
   - TestPyPI: https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/

2. When prompted for password, use your API token (starts with pypi-)

3. Test upload to TestPyPI first:
   twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

4. If successful, upload to real PyPI:
   twine upload dist/*

5. After upload, people can install with:
   pip install fixit-installer

Note: Your package name is "fixit-installer" not "fixit" (which was taken)
